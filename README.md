Requirements 
Weather app should have been updated with new features
1.Geolocation API (REQUIRED) LINK
Currently the API we are using requires the longitude and latitude to pull up the weather information for a city.  Using one of the APIs in the link above, get the longitude and latitude, from either the zip code or city, and feed that information in the current api to get weather information.
In other words, set up the text box to accept a city or zip code to display the weather information.  Thatâ€™s all the information you are getting around this requirement.
