# WeatherApp

I adjusted the code to meet the requirements by creating the conditional that checked if the input was a number meeaning a zipcode. Depending on if it was a number (zip) or string(city name) determined which url the code will begin retriving data from to push into the original url used in classed. This specific data retrived was the lat and long coordinates set as new variables and fed into the url used in class using template variables. It then retrives specific data from that url and writes on the html page using variables for the data.

Requirements 
Weather app should have been updated with new features
1.Geolocation API (REQUIRED) LINK
Currently the API we are using requires the longitude and latitude to pull up the weather information for a city.  Using one of the APIs in the link above, get the longitude and latitude, from either the zip code or city, and feed that information in the current api to get weather information.
In other words, set up the text box to accept a city or zip code to display the weather information.  Thatâ€™s all the information you are getting around this requirement.
